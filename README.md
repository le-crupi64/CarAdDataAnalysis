# CarAdDataAnalysis
This program uses Render and Python to allow users to gain insights about used car listings. These findings can be viewed in a Jupyter notebook or on the render app.  

You can use the render app at https://car-listing-data-analysis.onrender.com

To set up this program on your local machine, start by cloning the project's git repository. This can be done by using the 'git clone' command followed by the URL of the repository. Once you have the repository on your local machine, you can view the files in your preferred code editor. The project requires several libraries to run correctly, including pandas, scipy, streamlit, altair, and plotly. Make sure these libraries are installed on your local Python environment. If not, you can install them using pip, a package installer for Python.
